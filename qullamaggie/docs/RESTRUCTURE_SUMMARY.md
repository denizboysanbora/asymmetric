# Codebase Restructure Summary

## ✅ Completed Restructure

The codebase has been successfully restructured with a clear two-mode architecture and consistent terminology.

### 🎯 **New Architecture**

#### **Analyst Mode** - Market Analysis & Signal Generation
- **Purpose**: Scan markets and generate trading signals
- **Schedule**: 8 AM - 5 PM Eastern Time
- **Assets**: Both stocks and crypto
- **Outputs**: Email alerts + Twitter posts
- **No Trading**: Pure analysis and signal generation

#### **Investor Mode** - Trading Execution & Portfolio Management
- **Purpose**: Execute trades based on analyst signals
- **Schedule**: 8 AM - 5 PM Eastern Time
- **Function**: Uses Alpaca API for actual market transactions
- **Trading Logic**: Buy/sell decisions based on analyst signals

### 📁 **New Folder Structure**

```

### 🔄 **Key Changes Made**

1. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Replaced all "trader" references with "investor"
   - Clear separation between "analyst" and "investor" functions
   - Updated all script names and references

2. **Schedule Update**
   - Changed from 8 AM - 8 PM to 8 AM - 5 PM Eastern Time
   - Updated all time references in scripts and documentation

3. **File Organization**
   - Moved scanning logic to `analyst/scanner/`
   - Consolidated notifications under `analyst/notifications/`
   - Created trading execution in `investor/trading/`
   - Maintained database in `analyst/database/`

4. **New Control Scripts**
   - `start_analyst.sh` - Start analyst mode
   - `start_investor.sh` - Start investor mode
   - `stop_analyst.sh` - Stop analyst mode
   - `stop_investor.sh` - Stop investor mode
   - `status.sh` - Check both modes status

### 🚀 **Usage**

#### Start Modes
```bash
./start_analyst.sh    # Start market analysis
./start_investor.sh   # Start trading execution
```

#### Check Status
```bash
./status.sh           # Check both modes
```

#### Stop Modes
```bash
./stop_analyst.sh     # Stop market analysis
./stop_investor.sh    # Stop trading execution
```

### 📊 **System Flow**

1. **Analyst Mode**:
   - Scans markets every 5 minutes during 8 AM - 5 PM ET
   - Generates signals based on technical analysis
   - Sends email alerts and tweets
   - Logs all signals to database

2. **Investor Mode**:
   - Monitors database for recent signals
   - Executes trades based on signal strength
   - Manages portfolio positions
   - Performs risk management checks

### ✅ **Verification**

The restructure has been tested and verified:
- ✅ New folder structure created
- ✅ All scripts are executable
- ✅ Status script works correctly
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Consistent terminology throughout
- ✅ Updated schedule (8 AM - 5 PM ET)

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Configure API Keys**: Set up Alpaca, Gmail, and Twitter credentials
2. **Test Modes**: Run both analyst and investor modes
3. **Set up Cron**: Schedule both modes to run during operating hours
4. **Monitor**: Use status script to monitor system health
